## Rationale

* How the algorithm calculates the shortest distance
    * The program converts the vertices and segments into nodes and edges
    * Determines all the neighbours of each of the nodes
    * Finds the node which is closest in distance to the end node
* Reason to expand the library by implementing a new algorithm
    * The purpose of the algorithm is incredibly different compared to all the other programs in the island file which alters mainly polygons
    * This algorithm can be used in other situations being imported without the need of the other classes and files
